# Medicare Cost Analysis

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to build an app that shows the average Medicare cost for the top 100-most common medical diagnoses at different hospitals across the United States. The dataset comes from CMS, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 

The app would rely on a database with a number of different tables, including state, facility, diagnosis, etc. I imagine it would look similar to the Heritage Apps site we've built in class, with a page for providers (city, state, zip, etc.), and a page for diagnoses that would display average cost per provider, number of records, etc. Getting the data into this aggregated form would require some preprocessing, as right now it is at the one record per diagnosis per provider level.
