WORKING 
City_state
Referral_region
Drg --> drg_desc


NOT WORKING 
Address  --> street
Provider --> provider ID 


LIST OF VERSIONS 
7 - Each table loads individually. Using temp tables for address and provide.r 
8 - Trying to create non-temp tables and seeing if that works 
9 - Includes a bunch of commented out scripts at the bottom that I'll need to add in later. 
10 - Trying to fix the creation of the medicare_f table so that it includes all FKs. 
	- Still not getting match with FKs except for city_state_ID 
	(from example in MySQL WorkBench)
11 - Tried changing out 1212.csv file with new medicare_data_output.csv file 
	(Changed inspect_medicare_3.py script to create a new CSV) --> this is now in v3.5
	Changed inspect_medicare script to include trim function --> this is now in v4
	- Tried putting 1212.csv file back in (took out medicare_data_output) from medicare_initial
	- Checked and confirmed that lengths are the same in master file (output) and individual column (i.e. FK) file, such as referral_region_desc. For Anchorage-AK it's 14 bytes on both. Per https://support.office.com/en-us/article/len-lenb-functions-29236f94-cedc-429d-affd-b5e33d2c67cb
	- Tried adding in this function in inspect_medicare script v5 to ensure the encoding is the same 
		source_path = os.path.join('input', 'csv', 'met_data_seroka-orig.csv')
		encoding = find_encoding(source_path)
		source_data_frame = read_csv(source_path, encoding, '\t')
	- Trying with 1212.csv file initially
12 - Tried changing the location of the so it's in the same directory.  --> NOTE: Did not actually try this.
13 - New approach. Going to pull all from one CSV and use in-line SQL functions (get_unique equiv). to set up the database.
	- Successfully was able to create FK match by creating new column for referral_region_desc using SELECT DISTINCT from main table. 
	- Now deleting load data infile (won't pull from CSV anymore) for referral_region and will try inserting my new code into the medicare_initial.sql file
14 - Trying my new trick on all the tables with FKs not just referral_region. 5 in total (see above for list)






INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING DB 

0. Activate venv under Scripts 

1. Run medicare_data_prep_make_fewer_records.py (from home dir). This creates the city_state column. 

2. Run inspect_medicare_data_sets_5.py. This does some trimming and creates some extra CSVs. However, the output of this will be used in my main SQL db script so it's important.

3. Run SQL script: 

 C:\Users\chodge\Google Drive\SI664\medicare\scripts>python run_mysql_script.py -c config/medicare.yaml -p input/sql/medicare_initial_14.sql


STEP BY STEP - WHAT THE medicare_initial.sql SCRIPT IS DOING 
1. Create non M2M tables 
	- city_stae
	- referral_region
	- drg



2. Create temp M2M tables without any FK relationships 
	- provider_temp
	- address_temp
	- t_medicare_1 (omnibus table that has all data)

4. Load CSVs in using localinfile 
	- city_state        city_state_name
	- referral_region   referral_region_desc
	- drg               drg_desc
	- provider_temp     old_provider_id
	- address_temp      street
	- medicare_data      (all variables)

	** These are all loading successfully

5. Create regular (not temp) M2M tables with FK references
	- provider
	- address
	- t_medicare_1

	*In each of these, I'm doing a left join from the temp table to pull in the right data 

	- address: 
		-
